🕹️ Horror Survival Game

🔥 Overview

Welcome to Horror Survival, a terrifying experience set in a vast, dark world filled with eerie structures, abandoned houses, and a deadly underground bunker. Your goal? Survive. But beware—you're not alone...

👁️ Story & Gameplay

🌑 The game takes place at night, where a tall, sinister creature lurks in the shadows. It moves only when you're not looking. Staring at it will cause your screen to distort with static interference before you meet your end. It can teleport, stalk you through the map, and attack unexpectedly.

💀 If it catches you, a terrifying jumpscare animation plays, marking the end of your journey.

🎯 Objectives

Collect 8 notes scattered across the map.

Each note contains a digit of a secret code required to access the underground bunker.

Once inside, avoid a more advanced monster with AI tracking that can hear your movements, patrols specific zones, and actively searches for you if detected.

Escape the bunker and survive!
